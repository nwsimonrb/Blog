Nature brought forth humans, then humans brought forth technology. Technology brought forth humans adapted to it, which broucht forth nature adapted to humans. After the extension of human nature, nature itself changed and began to loose its sustenance.
<!-- <cite>- Edward V Berard -</cite> -->


As the change carries on, two major pathways unfold. On the one side, a small portion of humans can try to uphold their standard of living by building isolated spaces of refuge. On the other side, a majority of humans can try to control their unsustainable behavior by following scientific models enforced through technocracies. 

No matter which path taken, technology increasingly becomes the gateway to our interaction with the environment - be it in a natural state or man-made. If software models represent the intelligence of technology, electronics can be seen as its sensory and executive organs. But what about its nervous system for delivering information? In IT such is called a monitoring infrastructure. It has long been used to provide status updates on the health of technological components within IT sysems themself. But with the increasing importance of "environmental" data collection and inter-system communication, monitoring needs have evolved.

With increased data volume, velocity and veracity, monitoring has to be highly dynamic about scaling, processing and integrating. New technologies like **serverless, event streaming and API connectors** have come up to tackle those problems. In the folloging blog posts we will look into the inner workings and application capabilites of such. To pay attention to the bigger picture I try to encompas all three perspectives of "technological functionality", "human (business) application scenarios" and "environmental impact or nature-inspired design". 

With time I might extend the content to include topics not only from my current field of work (monitoring).  Semiconductor products and machine learning are two exemplery areas of interest that fit into the domains of electronic capability and synthetic intelligence. Of course IT hard- and software is far from becoming completely sustainable or even "organic". However, the pursuit of such is in my greatest interest and, hopefully, in humanities as well. 

We <u>can</u> make technology adapt to nature, bringing forth technology adapted humans who are <u>also</u> adapted to a changing nature. If one day technology and nature fully intertwine, humanity might have found its full potential.
